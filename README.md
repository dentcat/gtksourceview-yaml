YAML Syntax Highlighting
========================

**yaml.lang** enables basic YAML syntax highlighting for GtkSourceView
2.0 and 3.0.

## Installation

Download and place `yaml.lang` into one of the following directories
depending on the version of GtkSourceView that you are using:

    - `~/.local/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/`    
    - `~/.local/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/`    
    - `/usr/share/gtksourceview-2.0/language-specs/`    
    - `/usr/share/gtksourceview-3.0/language-specs/`    

Remember to restart your program for the change to take effect.
